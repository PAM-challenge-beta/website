Here is the companion website of our project presented at the workshop [DCLDE 2024](https://www.dclde2024.com/) in Rotterdam. It aims at pushing forward a data challenge for our PAM community dedicated to the detection and classification of marine mammal sounds!

IMPORTANT MESSAGE : all this work is very preliminary and should be seen as discussion material for the DCLDE2024 workshop. We are basically at DCLDE2024 to see whether there is some appetite to build a joined initiative towards this objective! So please come discuss at our poster stand, and∕or provide feedbacks through this [survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1he6ldQI8mkTz2HP4bPNZ9mwRTqLPsQHiHk3Sp1iiq1w/edit#heading=h.dczeyh71fi7a).
